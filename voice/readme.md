TTS Experiments
======

My eldest asked me to recreate [SCP-079](http://scpwiki.com/scp-079), and after a few minutes of research I found [annyang](https://www.talater.com/annyang/), a javascript bundle to add speech recognition to any website.

After a few minutes, I was able to create some simple demos:

* [Echo](echo.html)
* [Radio](radio.html)

But now I'm looking for some chatbots to throw at it...

* [ELIZA](./ELIZA)
