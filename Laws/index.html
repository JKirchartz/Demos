            Any piece of software reflects the organizational
            structure that produced it "Organisations often produce
            web sites with a content and structure which mirrors
            the internal concerns of the organisation rather than
            the needs of the users of the site." ~ Nigel Bevan

        Man-Month</i>)</p>
        <aside class="notes">
          It takes time to become productive in a new project,
          helping people become productive makes the productive
          people unproductive. Communication takes time, and
          there's only so many tasks that can happen simultaneously
          without people stepping on eachothers toes. Too many
          cooks spoils the soup.

          All discussions of incremental updates to Bugzilla will
          eventually trend towards proposals for large scale
          redesigns or feature additions or replacements for
          Bugzilla.
        </blockquote>
        <p>— Mike Beltzner</p>
        <aside class="notes">
          Dave Miller owned the Bugzilla product, probably saw this
          happen a lot. Iterating on software tends towards
          scope/feature creep, or complete and total redesign.
          Redesign will likely ignore previously fixed bugs, it's
          better to pay off techical debt; not all suggested
          features are valuable to all clients.

          develops a competence inversion." with incompetence being
          "flushed out of the lower levels" of a technocratic
          hierarchy, ensuring that technically competent people
          remain directly in charge of the actual technology while
          those without technical competence move into management.

        <h2>Gall's Law</h2>
        <blockquote>
"A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple
system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and
cannot be patched up to make it work."

          From Gall's book `Systemantics: How Systems Really Work and How They Fail.`
          The World Wide Web &amp; Blogosphere are successes of this gradual build-up to complexity.

        <h2>Greenspun's Tenth Rule</h2>
        <blockquote>
"Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp."
</blockquote>
        <p>— Philip Greenspun</p>
        <aside class="notes">
          I'm not a LISPer, but the story goes that LISP
          contains the functionality to write any complex program, and any
          program written in a language without LISP's functionality would have
          to implement some LISP methods.  Greenspun didn't have 9 other laws
          preceding this, and later Robert Morris added the corollary
          "...including Common Lisp" because a lot of Common Lisp
          implementations relied on C.
