                                Any piece of software reflects the organizational structure that produced it
                                "Organisations often produce web sites with a content and structure which mirrors the internal concerns of the organisation rather than the needs of the users of the site." ~ Nigel Bevan

                        It takes time to become productive in a new project, helping people become productive makes the productive people unproductive.
                        Communication takes time, and there's only so many tasks that can happen simultaneously without people stepping on eachothers toes.

                        All discussions of incremental updates to Bugzilla will eventually trend towards proposals for large scale redesigns or feature additions or replacements for Bugzilla.

                <aside class="notes">
                        Dave Miller owned the Bugzilla product, probably saw this happen a lot. Iterating on software tends towards scope/feature creep, or complete and total redesign.
                        Redesign will likely ignore previously fixed bugs, it's better to pay off techical debt; not all suggested features are valuable to all clients.
